    "# Question 1 : What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y) by fitting a straight line to the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It assumes that the relationship between X and Y can be expressed using a linear equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Y=β0+β1X+ε\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "The main objectives of SLR are:\n",
    "To understand the relationship between variables\n",
    "It helps determine whether and how strongly one variable influences another.\n",
    "To predict outcomes\n",
    "Given a new value of X, SLR can predict the corresponding value of Y.\n",
    "To quantify the effect of X on Y\n",
    "indicates how much Y changes for a one-unit increase in X.\n",

    "# Question 2: What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between the independent variable (X) and dependent variable (Y) must be linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means changes in Y are proportional to changes in X.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ Checked using scatter plots or residual plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence of Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals (errors) should be independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "One observation’s error should not influence another’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ Commonly violated in time-series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of errors should be constant across all values of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors should not fan out or shrink as X increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ Checked using residual vs. fitted value plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normality of Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals should be normally distributed, especially for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not mean X or Y must be normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ Checked using histograms or Q–Q plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No Perfect Multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Since SLR has only one independent variable, this assumption is automatically satisfied.\n",
